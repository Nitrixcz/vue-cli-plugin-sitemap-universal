#### What are sitemaps?

From [sitemaps.org](https://www.sitemaps.org):
> Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters  to inform search engines about pages on
> their sites that are available for crawling.  In its simplest form, a sitemap is
> an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each
> URL (when it was  last updated, how often it usually  changes, and how important
> it is,  relative to  other URLs  in the site)  so that  search engines  can more
> intelligently crawl  the site.  Web crawlers usually  discover pages  from links
> within the  site and from  other sites. Sitemaps  supplement this data  to allow
> crawlers that  support sitemaps  to pick up  all URLs in  the sitemap  and learn
> about those URLs using the associated  metadata. Using the sitemap protocol does
> not guarantee that web pages are  included in search engines, but provides hints
> for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site.
