**vue-cli-plugin-sitemap** generates sitemaps  for your webapps. You  can use it
on its own or integrate it in the definition of your routes. Features:
 * generate sitemaps from an array of routes
 * support for dynamic routes
 * automatically escape the URLs and enforce a (non-)trailing slash policy
 * optionally prettify the output

#### What are sitemaps?

From [sitemaps.org](https://www.sitemaps.org):
> Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters  to inform search engines about pages on
> their sites that are available for crawling.  In its simplest form, a sitemap is
> an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each
> URL (when it was  last updated, how often it usually  changes, and how important
> it is,  relative to  other URLs  in the site)  so that  search engines  can more
> intelligently crawl  the site.  Web crawlers usually  discover pages  from links
> within the  site and from  other sites. Sitemaps  supplement this data  to allow
> crawlers that  support sitemaps  to pick up  all URLs in  the sitemap  and learn
> about those URLs using the associated  metadata. Using the sitemap protocol does
> not guarantee that web pages are  included in search engines, but provides hints
> for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site.

## Installation

```
vue add sitemap
```

The plugin will  add a script called `sitemap` to  your `package.json`. No other
files will be modified.

## Usage

The sitemap  will be  generated upon  building your app.  To examine  the output
without triggering the  whole build process, you can run  the following command,
which will generate a sitemap in the current working directory:
```
npm run sitemap
```

## Configuration

#### URL meta tags

In the sitemap format,  each URL can be associated with  some optional meta tags
to help the crawlers prioritize the critical URLs.

 Meta tag  |                                                   Accepted values                                                         | Default value if absent
---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------
lastmod    | a date string in the [W3C format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), a JavaScript timestamp string, or a `Date` object | none
changefreq | `"always"`, `"hourly"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"`, `"yearly"`, `"never"`                                         | none
priority   | a multiple of `0.1` between `0.0` and `1.0`                                                                               | `0.5`

For  more information  on those  meta tags,  you can  consult the  official spec
[here](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions).

#### Global settings

All the  global settings are optional  and can be omitted,  except for `baseURL`
that must be provided for routes-based sitemaps.

```javascript
// vue.config.js

module.exports = {
	pluginOptions: {
		// [â€¦]

		sitemap: {

			// The default parameters for every URL
			defaults: {
				changefreq: 'weekly',

			},
		}
	}
}

```
